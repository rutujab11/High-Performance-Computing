# High-Performance-Computing
List of programs:
1. Bubblesort
2. Vector addition
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Quicksort

In all programs serial time(Ts) and parallel time(Tp) for execution has been calculated.
Pragma directives used for calculation of parallel time.

Performance Metrics:

1. Speedup
   speedup = Ts/Tp
   
2. Efficiency
   efficiency = speedup/p
        p = no. of processors
